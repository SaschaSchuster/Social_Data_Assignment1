Collaborative Assignment1
=======================

This is the public repository required for the first assignment for the course 'Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis', taught by @ChristopherGandrud at the Hertie School of Governance, Berlin, in 2014. It was made by @wwellis and @SaschaSchuster. It displays a barplot showing the arrests for murder in all 50 US states per 100k population in 1973, and some descriptive information on the swiss data set.
